/**
 * Game interface for audio
 *
 * The logical sources represent all entities in the world, from the client's point of view.
 * Their number can be higher than the number of simultaneous playable sound on the soundcard.
 *
 * When there are more sources than tracks, the process of choosing which sources go into
 * the tracks is called "balancing". The source are auto-balanced according to the
 * argument passed to init(). The sources are also balanced when
 * - Adding a new source
 * - Removing a new source
 * - Entering/Exiting from an envsound area
 *
 * Important: The user is responsible for deleting the sources that have been allocated by
 * createSource(), before deleting the audio mixer object.
