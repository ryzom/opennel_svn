	 * \param zones The 0 is the center zone to be computed. Other are the 4 zones around (no special order needed).
	 *	Doesn't matter if zones[i].Patchs is NULL. Also, if a neighbor patch is not found on a edge, then no error is 
	 *  generated: this patch edge is not modified.
	 *	nlstop if zones[0]==NULL.
	 * \param angleThreshold if angle beetween (patch_interior - tangent) and (neighbor_patch_interior - tangent) is 
	 *	above angleThreshold, no smooth is done on this tangent. Default: 30deg.
	 * \param continuityC1. when a smooth is done on a tangent, tangent is forced such that the 2 interiors and the 
	 *	tangent are colinear, so continuity G1 is assured. if continuityC1 is true, then tangent is set to the middle of 
	 *	the interiors (continuity C1). If false, tangent is setup so that previous distance ratio are kept.
