 * This is a helper texture that helps to blend between 2 others textures. It may help where sharing is needed.
 * (for example, with a texture that blend between day / night, and that is shared by several object). The default is
 * to have sharing enabled. 
 * NB : sharing is only supported if the 2 blending textures support sharing
 * IMPORTANT: you should setup all your blend texture after changing the blend factor to avoid previous texture
 * to be left in VRAM
